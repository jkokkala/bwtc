Burrows-Wheeler Transform based compression program

at the moment: in early development phase

...

Compile the program by saying "make" in project-folder. Tests can be run
with "make tests".

...

New functionality can be added by replacing some of the trivial implementations
of the preprocessing, bwt or entropy encoding.

When one wants to add new preprocessing implementation, one needs
to do to following things:

 - compr.cc:
   * update ValidatePreprocOption()-function to accept new option 
   * update options_description-object in main()

 - preprocessor.cc
   * update GivePreProcessor-function to accept new value for parameter

For adding new probability model used for arithmetic coding one needs
to add new implementation which uses ProbabilityModel in base_prob_model.h
as a base class. Then next files need to be modified:

 - compr.cc:
   * update options_description-object in main()-function
   * update ValidateEncodingOption()-function to accept new option

 - coders.cc:
   * update GiveProbabilityModel()-function to give new model
