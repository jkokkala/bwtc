In Linux you can compile this by first generating makefiles with CMake.
Go to the root-directory and type
  'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type .', where type is 'Release' or 'Debug'
After this program can be compiled by saying 'make'. Tests are run by
'make test'.
Profiling can be turned on by giving "-D PROFILER=1" to cmake, for example:
  'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D PROFILER=1 .'
