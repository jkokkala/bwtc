Burrows-Wheeler Transform based compression program

at the moment: in early development phase

...

New functionality can be added by replacing some of the trivial implementations
of the preprocessing, bwt or entropy encoding.

When one wants to add new preprocessing implementation, one needs
to do to following things:

 - compr.cc:
   * update validate_preproc_opt to accept new option for preprocessing
   * update options_description-object in int main()

 - preprocessor.cc
   * update GivePreProcessor-function to accept new value for parameter
